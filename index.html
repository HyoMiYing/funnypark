 <h1>The Funenpark</h1>
<p>
The Funenpark (also called Funen) is a small neighborhood on the Eastern Islands in Amsterdam, between the Czaar Peterbuurt, 
    the Cruquiuskade and the railway between CS and Muiderpoort. Until the 19th century, the bulwark Zeeburg was located here. 
    During excavations for the construction of the new housing estate, the wall remains of the stronghold emerged. 
    The remains are now permanently visible. After that, a transshipment site was established until the end of the seventies of the twentieth century. 
    After a long period of vacancy, 551 homes were built in the late 1990s. These are in the Funenpark.

The urban plan is by the hand of former Chief Government Architect Frits van Dongen. 
    The district consists of the car-free Funenpark with 16 residential blocks, each with a different design. 
    The triangular park is enclosed on the south and east sides by the apartments on the Cruquiuskade and the Keerwal (along the railway), 
    and on the west side by a park. In the Funenpark, various housing groups, students, families and older people have built homes 
    ranging from social housing to owner-occupied homes in the more expensive segment.

After a public vote, the last residential block Verdana won in 2011 won the Amsterdam New Building Award,
    after several blocks had already been nominated in the Funenpark in previous years. Noteworthy is that the choice of the Amsterdammers
    differs from the valuation by experts: Verdana was not found representative of residential construction in 2010, while the earlier
    nominations could count on more appreciation. In 2011 Het Funen was also declared the winner of the Golden Pyramid,
    the Rijksprijs for inspiring commissioning.
